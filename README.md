# Inception-Based Global Context Attention CNN
The aim of this research is to develop a disease-detection approach for coffee leaves based on deep learning. The network is developed with inception modules, a global context module, and a multi-head attention module to achieve precise classification. The experimental results indicated that the proposed network achieved an accuracy of 98.57%.
